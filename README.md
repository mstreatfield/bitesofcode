Bites of Code
=============

The Blog
--------

[Bites of Code][1] is a blog authored by a former colleague Eric Hulser to provide guidance, tips-and-tricks and knowledge about [PyQt][2] programming and development.

It contains a number of tutorials that walk through the basics of GUI porgramming, PyQt and Qt Designer, before taking you through the process of developing a complete application (Nexsys).

The Code
--------

This repository is a collection of all the code associated with the blog, organised by tutorial. This is to serve as an additional reference point for working code and future development, beyond what is contained in the blog posts.
